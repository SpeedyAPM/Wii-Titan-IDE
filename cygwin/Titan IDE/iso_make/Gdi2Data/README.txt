Gdi2Data by Familyguy						(v2.1)


This pack is meant to automatically extract data from a gdi image of a dreamcast game.
It can also extract data from non-gdi dreamcast files,but with user-input.


==============

USE:

1) Copy the tracks and GDI file (if you got it) of the game you want to extract to the 
   root folder of the pack.

2) Run Gdi2Data.bat and follow the instructions, it'll extract the data from your gdi 
   image files into the data folder, and put the ip.bin in the root folder of the pack.
   It also supports non-gdi dumps, but you'll have to manually specify some parameters.

   TIP: The starting LBA of the last data track can be found by running gdinfo_FG on 
        the ip.bin (or track03.iso) of the game. gdinfo_FG.exe is in the Utilities folder.

2) Do whatever you want to do with the files.

==============

I hope you'll find this useful
